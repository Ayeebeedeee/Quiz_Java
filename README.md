Hello viewers! Welcome to one of my latest projects. It's been a while since I last uploaded code, and Iâ€™m excited to share this one with you.

This project is a simple 5-question quiz game built in Java. The game presents 5 questions to the user, accepts their input, and calculates their final score. Each correct answer earns +1 point, while an incorrect answer scores 0.

While building this project, I gained a clear understanding of getters, setters, and encapsulation, which are fundamental concepts in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

This project also served as a great way for me to resume my journey as a Java developer and sharpen my Java programming skills.
