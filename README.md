Hello viewers, welcome to another one of my repositories. It's been a while since I last uploaded any code.
This code is a simple, basic 5-question quiz game that poses 5 questions to the user, takes their input, and calculates their respective score at the end. Every correct answer grants +1 mark, while an incorrect answer gives them 0.
While making this project, I gained a crystal-clear understanding of getters and setters, as well as encapsulation, which is one of the fundamental concepts of OOP.
Additionally, it was a great way for me to resume my journey as a Java developer and polish my Java skills.
