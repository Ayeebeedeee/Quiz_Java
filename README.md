Hello viewers, welcome to my another repository, it's been a while since I last uploaded any code.
This code is about a simple basic 5 questions quiz game which poses 5 questions to the user, takes the user input and calculates his/her respective score at the end. Every correct answer grants him/her +1 mark and an incorrect answer leaves them with a big round 0.
Adding to this, while making this project, I got a crystal clear overview of what getters and setters are and also about Encapsulation which is one of the basic concept of OOPs.
Also, it was a good source for me to resume my journey as a java deveploper and polish my java skills.
